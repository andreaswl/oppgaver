## The story

SprellBang AS wants to improve the mood of their employees, by distributing little gems of wisdom (known as "gullkorn" or "gems" for short). We will be writing a C program to manage and deliver these gems. Features will be added weekly, matching the [table of weekly group lecture topics](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~inf1060/Oppgaver11/):
